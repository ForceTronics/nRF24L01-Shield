# nRF24L01-Shield
This repository holds the Eagle files for an open source nRF24L01 Shield for Arduino. This Shield was designed by ForceTronics LLC and can be purchased at forcetronics.com

Note the Eagle Project nRF24L01 Shield uses parts from the ForceTronics.lbr file so you need to add it to your "lbr" folder.
